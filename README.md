## Project Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This dataset contains the reported Covid-19 statistics across more than
200 countries, including the total number of reported cases and deaths.
This data originated from the <https://www.worldometers.info/> which is
an online database that tracks real-time reported Covid-19 summary
statistics. This data was dated on the 22/01/2020.

This dataset contains a lot of information which can help deduce how
much Covid-19 impacted each individual country or continent.
Furthermore, we can identify how severe the Covid-19 virus is in terms
of how it affects the mortality rate for different countries.

## Project Goals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Identifying the top 10 counties with the highest and lowest reported
    Covid-19 cases
2.  Grouping the countries into their respective continents and deducing
    which continents have the highest and lowest reported Covid-19 cases
3.  Investigating the relationship between the number of reported
    Covid-19 tests and cases
4.  Looking at the relationship between the top 10 countries with the
    highest reported Covid-19 tests and cases
5.  Identifying the relationship between the total reported Covid-19
    cases and deaths
6.  Looking at the top 10 countries with the highest and lowest reported
    Covid-19 patient recovery rates
